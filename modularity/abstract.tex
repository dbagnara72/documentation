\section*{Abstract}

\medskip

This document concerns wind-turbine installations based on permanent magnet synchronous generators (PSM) connected to the grid via full power converters based on active-front-ends (AFEs) and a vector control based inverter drives.
The wind-turbine system is basically developed with a modularity concept, where the single basic unit (modular-unit) has a nominal power of 250kW. The final configuration is always a set of basic units connected in parallel mode to achieve the requirements (in terms of torque and/or active power) of the system. 
As would be \textit{natural} to think,  the modular concept strategy has an impact into the grid power quality, and the aim of this document consist on this investigation and analysis. 
Implicitly, the PSM harmonics contents and its propagation into the grid, with impact into the grid power quality will be investigated as well as how it is influenced by the modularity distribution.
Different scenario will be illustrated and analysed, in particular the investigation will focus on the major typology of installation.
